# BIT Announcement Notifier

Notify users the latest academic announcements posted in the bit.lk site 

This script sends a single request to the announcements page, extracts the latest postings and 
compares them to the previously fetched postings to identify any new announcements. If any new 
announcements are identified then those are sent to the users subscribed to the service.
